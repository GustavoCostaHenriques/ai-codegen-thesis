# AI-based Pipeline for Automated Software Development

This repository contains all artefacts related to the development of a Master’s Oriented Study thesis in Computer Engineering, focused on the design and implementation of an AI-based pipeline for automated software development.

The project is developed within the MSc in Computer Engineering at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon, in collaboration with Trust Systems.

The core objective is to design, implement, and evaluate a modular pipeline based on Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of transforming user's descriptions into software artefacts.

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this thesis are:

- Design a modular and incremental pipeline for automating software development stages
- Apply prompt engineering techniques to guide and control model behaviour
- Evaluate the quality and consistency of generated artefacts
- Integrate human-in-the-loop validation throughout the pipeline

---

## 🧠 Proposed Pipeline

The proposed solution is organised as an incremental pipeline composed of the following modules:

1. Requirements Structuring  
2. Interface Generation  
3. API Specification Generation  
4. Backend Code Generation  
5. Frontend Code Generation  
6. Infrastructure Generation  

Each module:
- consumes artefacts produced by the previous module,
- produces structured and reusable outputs,
- includes human validation before proceeding to the next stage.

## 🛠️ Orchestration Tool

The pipeline is orchestrated using **Flowise (self-hosted)**.
